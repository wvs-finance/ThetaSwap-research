The payoff of a liquidity perovider which lends it's position is decomposed as a covered call payoff

as seen on Kristensen

LP = P_T - (P_T - K)^+ + RangePayoff

Consider the payoff has a range component. One can tokenized range striuctured products and this can be used by liquidity proirders to hedge or do other thin. Additionally if time is ioncorm[portated. This can help control the welfacre maximizationn or pprice the JIT intrution

Given a way to len the liquidyt poistion. Which is akin as selling a covered call in Panoptic

Then decomposing the non-covered call paprt of the paylfoff of the LP as arange struictured note how ?

Thus the range payoff must be tested in such way that is equivalent to

LP(providing liquidity)  + short a perpetual futures (- P_T) + long a call option (max (P_T -K, 0)) = rangePayoff

# Advantages:

credit risk --> hack risk ==> hack risk < credit risk
- In traditional finance, the product is not standarized, and is usually not exchange-traded. However
the nature of LP's make the product possible to be tokenized and standarized considering the identity

LP(providing liquidity)  + short a perpetual futures (- P_T) + long a call option (max (P_T -K, 0)) = rangePayoff

# Replication

- RAN can be thought as a series of range cash-or-nothing (digital options)
- each option pays (feeGrowth/#Blocks (or observationPeriods))


  portafolio(strike) = (feeGrowth/#Blocks (strike), 0)
			   (cash)

Then the price of RAN is analytical when the price of digital options are calculated

# Paper


- fee-free LPing is akin to a 1/2 power perpetual (REF)
- fee-free LPing can be perfectly hedged with a squared perpetual payoff(REF)
- fee-free CLAMM position when lent is akin to shorting a covered call or a cash-secured put (REF)
- fee-free CLAMM positions alough more capital efficient (REF)
  - No LP would participate due to impermanent loss (REF)
- impermanent loss premia is needed to encourage LPing (REF)
- CLAMM imperment loss premia is the cash-flow induced by tradingFees on fee CLAMM(REF)
- fee CLAMM when lent needs to be paid by borrower of the LP position (REF -> Panoptic)
- fee CLAMM payoff is fee-free CLAMM payoff + RangePayoff component (REF)
- RangePayoff are part of LPing expected return (REF)
- RangePayoff are part of the LPing pricing (REF)
- RangePayoff capture the Theta component of LPing (REF)
- RangePayoffs can be standarized with RangeAccrualStructuredNotes (REF --> This is the work)
  - RangeStructuredNotes capture the Theta component of LPing (REF)
- RangeStructuredNotes pricing is uniquely determined by the  "impliedOccupationTime"
- "impliedOccupationTime" is uniquely determined by impliedVolatility
- Then the following ThetaSwap market emerges:

feeGrowth                E[T_ITM(impliedVolatility) -> "impliedOccupationTime"]
----------  *(    
observationFrequency

		- realizedOccupationTime(realizedVolatility) --> TO_BE_PROVED

- RangeStructuredNotes pricing is obtained analyticaly from a series of "delayed" digital option straddles (OR THE option strategy that bundles a long call with a strikePrice lowTick and a short call with a
strikePrice upperTick)

> This allows standarized diversifications for LP's and contributes to DeFi composability
> This allows mechanisms for pricing JIT externalities on PLP


## Implementation Notes

Given an active LiquidityPosition the LP:

      (afterAddLiquidity)
      
      mints a ThetaToken(isLong) --> RANGE_NOTE --> ERC1155 v ERC6909
      	    record RANGE_NOTE payoff --> 1 tokenShare entitles RANGE_NOTE_PAYOFF
     	    collect RANGE_NOTE collateral --> borrow from LPPosition

	    (other -> poolKey(ThetaToken, Collateral, fee? , tickSpacing ?, ILiquidityDensity(hook)))
	    provideLiquidity on CLAMM(RANGE_NOTE)
	    provide (ThetaToken, collateral) liquidity on CFMM(RANGE_NOTE)
	    	    - initial price must satisfy no-arbitrage
	    swap MUST rebalance to no-arbitrage price
	    If perpetual
	       - long must finance the short (FundingFee on CFMM(RANGE_NOTE))
	       	 ----induces---->
			-> liquidation
		        -> reedemption

    mints a ThetaToken(isShort)
    	  require (exist(liquidityPosition, params(RANGE_NOTE)))
